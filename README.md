## **Project 1: Navigation**
### *Project Details:*
This project is intended to introduce students to Unityâ€™s ML-Agents machine learning toolset and provide an opportunity to apply their knowledge of Deep Q-Learning networks to train a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent.  The environment used for this project includes 37 discrete states and 4 actions which include moving the agent forward, backward, left, and right to collect yellow bananas while avoiding blue bananas.  The state space includes an array of ray casts that provide the agent information to determine banana color, direction, and distance. To solve the episodic task, the agent must get an average score of +13 over 100 consecutive episodes.

### *Getting Started:*
This project is intended to be run from Udacity's Workspace environment.  All dependencies are included in the Navigation.ipynb when executed from the Udacity Workspace Jupyter notebook.  The checkpoint.pth file contains the saved model weights and will be required when executing the Navigation.ipynb cells.  Note: The existing checkpoint.pth model weights will be overwritten when executing the dqn() method.

### *Instructions:*
1) Upload Navigation.ipynb and checkpoint.pth to the Udacity Workspace Jupyter notebook.  
2) Open the Navigation.ipynb in the Jupyter notebook
3) Execute all cells below "4. It's Your Turn!"
